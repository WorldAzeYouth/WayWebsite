  "blog1_category": "History",
  "blog1_excerpt": "At a meeting with the first Prime Minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Hasan Hasanov, and the Young Ambassadors of Western Azerbaijan, new facts were presented about the founding history of the Atropatene state...",
  "blog1_introduction": "On January 27, the next meeting of the 'Young Ambassadors of Western Azerbaijan' was held with the first Prime Minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor Hasan Hasanov. As a Young Ambassador of Western Azerbaijan, this meeting was extremely interesting and beneficial for me. Many crucial points of our history were addressed, and some issues raised serious questions in my mind. Particularly, the facts presented about the foundation of the Atropatene state were entirely different from what we had known until now.",
  "blog1_historical": "We were always taught that this state was established in 321 BC after the collapse of Alexander the Great’s empire. However, during the meeting, it was revealed that Atropatene was actually founded much earlier – in 612 BC. If this fact is accepted, it means the history of Azerbaijani statehood goes back to a much earlier period and brings the issue of succession with ancient Turkic states in the region back into focus. Mr. Hasan substantiated this idea with various historical sources. Maps presented during the meeting showed that the traditions of Azerbaijani statehood developed in three main stages. In the first stage (starting from the 3rd millennium BC), tribal unions such as Turukkum, Lullubum, and Guttum (Gutians) existed in the South Caucasus and the current territory of Azerbaijan. These tribes are also mentioned in Assyrian sources, and it is noted that they had statehood traditions. In the second stage (9th–7th centuries BC), the states of Manna, Media, and Ashguz emerged. One remarkable detail is the existence of the Ashguz kingdom. In 673 BC, the Ashguz and Median states emerged, and this process laid the foundation for Atropatene. At that time, continuous confrontations with Assyria occurred. Finally, in 612 BC, with the fall of the Assyrian capital Nineveh, the Atropatene state was founded. Ancient authors such as Ctesias and Diodorus wrote that Babylonian governor Belesus and the Median king Arbai (Arpat) united against Assyria. The Ashguz kingdom also joined this coalition, resulting in the formation of a new state – Adorbaygan (Atropatene).",
  "blog1_modern": "One of the most interesting aspects is that after its establishment, Atropatene was known by different names for a long time. Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus wrote that a state named Atropatene emerged on the borders of Media after the collapse of Assyria. The Syrian source 'Karxi de bet Selox' states that this state was founded by Arbai, king of the Ashguz kingdom. So why are these facts not in the textbooks? The reason lies in the stereotypes formed by Soviet historiography. Igrar Aliyev, based on the writings of Strabo, claimed that Atropatene was founded in 321 BC. However, Strabo only stated that 'Atropatene regained its independence after Alexander's death,' which shows that Atropatene already existed but was under vassal dependency during Alexander’s rule.",
  "blog1_conclusion": "Acceptance of these facts answers several historical questions: 1. It proves that Atropatene was not of Persian origin but a Turkic state founded in 612 BC. 2. It shows its Scythian-Saka (Ashguz) origin and its connection to the Oghuz Turks. 3. It invalidates the claims of Armenian historiography over Atropatene since the first reference to Armenians dates back to 521 BC, while Atropatene already existed since 612 BC. This topic should be widely discussed, and our history should be thoroughly studied. The better we understand our past, the stronger we can build our future. The history of Azerbaijani statehood is older than we thought and is of vital importance for our national identity.",

  "blog2_excerpt": "Within the framework of the Young Ambassadors of Western Azerbaijan program, we participated in a valuable meeting about the true history of Atropatene, one of the significant pages of Azerbaijani statehood history...",
  "blog2_introduction": "Within the framework of the 'Young Ambassadors of Western Azerbaijan' program, we participated in a valuable meeting about the true history of Atropatene, one of the significant pages in the history of Azerbaijani statehood. The facts presented by Hasan Hasanov, the first Prime Minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Doctor of Historical Sciences, gave us a new perspective on the founding history of Atropatene.",
  "blog2_historical": "For many years, debates have continued in the field of history regarding the founding date of Atropatene. According to the traditional view, this state was established after the death of Alexander the Great. However, academic research and ancient written sources indicate that Atropatene was actually formed in 612 BC. This major historical shift is related to the fall of the Assyrian Empire. Neo-Babylonian cuneiform texts and notes by Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus confirm that Atropatene was established through the joint efforts of Media and the Scythians. Ancient sources show that the founder of this state was a Scythian ruler named Arbai (Arbat). Initially, the state was called 'Adorbaygan', and it later became known as 'Atropatene'.",
  "blog2_modern": "Although Strabo wrote that Atropatene was founded in 321 BC after Alexander’s empire collapsed, these ideas are sometimes misunderstood. In reality, Strabo stated that the state regained its independence at that time. Polybius and other ancient authors noted that Atropatene existed long before Alexander. Historical maps and written records show that the territory of this state stretched from Derbent to Isfahan. The founders of this state were of Scythian-Saka (Ashguz) origin. Herodotus recorded that the terms 'Scythian' and 'Saka' referred to the same people, while Greek sources described them as 'Guz'. This proves Atropatene’s connection to the ancient Oghuz tribes and shows that the genetic-cultural roots of the Azerbaijani people go back to very ancient times.",
  "blog2_conclusion": "The acceptance of Atropatene's foundation in 612 BC allows a re-evaluation of Azerbaijan’s political and historical identity. In addition to countering distortions by Persian and Armenian sources, it proves the existence of ancient Azerbaijani statehood traditions. These academic justifications are very important for presenting Azerbaijan’s historical realities correctly at the international level. This meeting gave us, the youth, motivation to learn our history more deeply and pass it on to future generations. Revealing the true history of Atropatene and combating false narratives is a crucial responsibility we bear. More extensive research should be conducted in this field, and efforts should be made for its global recognition.",

  "blog3_category": "Young Ambassadors",
  "blog3_excerpt": "I had the chance to meet Hasan Hasanov thanks to the Young Ambassadors project of the Western Azerbaijan Community. The selected topic was clear – the founding of the Atropatene state...",
  "blog3_introduction": "I had the chance to meet Hasan Hasanov through the 'Young Ambassadors of the Western Azerbaijan Community' project. The chosen topic was clear – 'The founding of the Atropatene state and its historical borders'. To be honest, at first, the selection of this topic was a bit unexpected for me. One question popped into my mind – why specifically Atropatene? But after the meeting, everything became clear. As Hasan Hasanov said, if we are the young ambassadors spreading the history of Western Azerbaijan, then we must deeply understand the history of these lands. We must be able to prove everything we know, believe in, and are certain about with evidence. Because history is not just a chronological record of past events – it is a window to the future.",
  "blog3_historical": "We were given valuable information about the ancient history of the Atropatene state, which extended from the Golden River in the west to the Caspian Sea in the east, from the Caucasus Mountains in the north to Lake Urmia in the south, and which was actually founded after the disintegration of the Assyrian Empire around 612 BC. Throughout the meeting, it was emphasized how challenging it is to defend these historical facts and the importance of proving them with evidence. Because history is a hidden secret, and the information provided by Hasan Hasanov, supported with evidence, raises new questions and becomes even more intriguing. The idea that the Scythians – the Umman-Manda people – who were the dominant nation at the time, destroyed Assyria, contradicts Herodotus’ claim that the Medes destroyed Assyria. For us young ambassadors, this presents a new alternative for the world.",
  "blog3_modern": "Hasan Hasanov also stated that the burden of spreading this knowledge to the world lies on us, the young ambassadors. Another trait I noticed in him was that he responded to those who tried to distort our history by striking back with the truth of our history. Our history should be the power that makes us speak, not silences us. Perhaps when he noticed that some answers were given hesitantly during the meeting, he said, 'say it louder,' as a reminder of that. Our history belongs only to us, and only we can know the truth of it. So why should we be hesitant to speak it out loud? Hasan Hasanov did not shy away from groundless accusations because he knew the truth and called on us to learn it too. During the meeting, the frequently debated question 'Are we Turks or Azerbaijanis?' was also asked. The distinguished historian answered, 'we are Turkic-origin Azerbaijanis,' reminding us once again of our true identity.",
  "blog3_conclusion": "There was so much to talk about during the meeting, but the time was short. I believe this valuable meeting with our historian Hasan Hasanov should have had two parts. There was still much to discuss and learn. For me, this meeting was not just a historical lecture but a call for national identity, historical memory, and self-confidence. Every idea and piece of evidence presented by Hasan Hasanov is a responsibility and an obligation for us young people. Now is the time to speak about our history not with silence, but with confidence and evidence.",

  "blog4_introduction": "Every meeting we attend as Young Ambassadors brings us new knowledge and perspectives. Our meeting with Mr. Hasan was no exception. The facts mentioned about the historical connections between Atropatene and Western Azerbaijan especially caught our attention. During the meeting, we saw how historical processes resonate with today's realities and how this topic is analyzed in the context of international relations.",
  "blog4_historical": "The state of Atropatene existed in the historical territory of Azerbaijan and laid the foundation for the region's ancient traditions of statehood. As Mr. Hasan emphasized, the historical legacy of this state is closely connected to the lands of Western Azerbaijan. The cultural heritage and ethnic structure formed in these lands since ancient times clearly demonstrate the Azerbaijani people's connection to these territories.",
  "blog4_modern": "Approaching the issue not only from a historical but also from an international relations perspective taught us analytical thinking. Understanding how historical facts align with modern political processes is essential for building correct future strategies. The meeting was rich in both information exchange and mutual discussions.",
  "blog4_conclusion": "Such events not only provide us with knowledge but also allow us to analyze historical events in a broader context. We hope that meetings like this will continue and bring us new perspectives. We thank Mr. Hasan and the organizers!",

  "blog5_introduction": "One of the most fundamental issues of modern Azerbaijani statehood is its historical profile. Hasan Hasanov's deep knowledge and determination undoubtedly prove Azerbaijan's role and unique position in world history. Despite the repressive atmosphere during the Soviet era, he opposed the system, studied the fundamental structure of Azerbaijani history, and tried to preserve this heritage for future generations.",
  "blog5_historical": "This presentation discussed not only the historical lands of Azerbaijan but also the identities of neighboring states, revealing the historical realities of the region. Unfortunately, historical facts are sometimes distorted and manipulated in popular media by our neighbors such as Armenia and Iran. However, this meeting held within the framework of the 'Young Ambassadors of Western Azerbaijan' project served as a beacon for young researchers. Historical references and years of academic research guide us toward a clearer future.",
  "blog5_modern": "In the modern era, introducing the inviolability of our territorial integrity to countries like France, which suffers from traditional Turkophobia at the UN Security Council, requires not just academic knowledge but serious diplomatic courage. In my opinion, the most valuable investment in the future is understanding history correctly and drawing conclusions from it. Atropatene, Manna, Caucasian Albania, and similar ancient states have played an important role in shaping our Azerbaijani identity. The most important aspect of this meeting for me was that Hasan Hasanov shared his position with young people both as a scholar and as a public figure.",
  "blog5_conclusion": "Succeeding in both fields is a rare skill, and I believe that continuously using the knowledge I gained during this seminar will also play an important role in my personal development. Organizing such events greatly contributes to the young generation's deeper understanding of our national history and helps form a firm, scientifically based position. Hasan Hasanov's research once again proves that Azerbaijani history is not only geographically bounded but also of global cultural and political significance. Presenting and protecting historical facts correctly on the international stage plays a vital role in defending our country’s interests. This meeting also showed that, along with an academic approach, public diplomacy is extremely important in conveying the truths about Azerbaijan to the world."
